## ⚠️ Limited Contract Surface

This brief covers only 0 contract implementation(s). The pipeline may not have discovered all deployed contracts for this project.
Coverage assessment and audit matching are based on this incomplete surface.

## Project Description

No contract logic was present for AlphaX in the closed normalized topography run; this brief does not infer a protocol purpose from missing code.

### Architecture

The activated project remains an explicit cohort member with an empty normalized logic-topography closure.

## Logic Topography

- Exact-run contract rows: 0
- Structural roles: none
- Contract kinds: none
- Detected standards: none
- Frameworks: none
- Upgradeable-pattern rows: 0

## Contract Surface Quality

- Operational liveness prerequisite: not_applicable; 0/0 eligible owned address-book contracts resolved from completed operational-liveness snapshots.
- Logic-topography rows: 0; live/inactive and live-deployment-unit totals are withheld until liveness completes.
- Detected codebases: none
- Dependencies extracted: 0; unverified dependencies: 0.

## Audit Coverage Summary

- Coverage of address-book-owned deployed-live implementations: not assessable
- Coverage assessment: not_assessable (low confidence) — No eligible owned address-book contracts are available for an operational-liveness denominator.
- Address-book implementation classification: 0 own, 0 exact-address-book context/dependencies excluded, 0 exact-address-book entries needing review
- Outside the address book: 2 discovered implementations shown in the inventory but excluded from coverage (0 third-party/infra; 0 standard proxy/library)
- Proxy deployments represented within implementation groups: 1
- Operational liveness: not_applicable; 0/0 eligible owned address-book contracts resolved. Deployed-live counts are withheld from coverage.
- All block-explorer-verified implementations audited (incl. non-live): 0/2
- Verified + Unaudited implementations: 2
- Verified by bytecode match: 0
- Unverified implementations: 0
- Unique implementations: 2
- Raw deployments: 3
- Audits discovered: 1 (1 direct, 0 inherited from forked code)
- Scoreable audits (matched contracts): 0
- ASD (verified + unaudited TVL): n/a
- Latest audit: n/a (unknown)
- Audit staleness (calendar age): 0 fresh, 0 aging, 0 stale, 1 unknown
- Coverage code basis (deployed vs audited code): 0 code-matched, 0 diverged (deployed code modified beyond the audited fork baseline), 0 match-unverified
- Tier 1 coverage: No Tier 1 coverage

## Deployer Expansion Inventory

These rows are additive inventory from `project_contracts.discovery_source=deployer_expansion`; they do not change scope matching, coverage, or logic topography in this brief.

- Source: `project_contracts.discovery_source=deployer_expansion`
- Decision run: `deployer-candidate-production-20260712`
- Total contracts: 2
- Live contracts: 0
- Unknown liveness contracts: 2
- Source-verified contracts: 2
- Currently scope-matched contracts retained as-is: 0
- Classification counts: source verified unclassified=2

## Audit Inventory

| Audit | Auditor | Audit Type | Date | Freshness | Inheritance | Scope Format | Scope Result | Own Matches | Proxy Refs | Excluded/Context | Unresolved | Extraction Confidence |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---:|---:|---:|---:|---|
| [AlphaX Audit final.pdf](https://github.com/AlphaX-Protocol/AlphaX-Protocol-Contract/blob/master/Audit-Report/AlphaX%20Audit%20final.pdf) | unknown | Audit | n/a | unknown | Direct | contract_name | no match | 0 | 0 | 0 | 1 | medium |

### Scope Outcome Records

These are completed scope-analysis outcomes, not missing matcher runs. Explicit-zero results retain their unresolved/context references below.

- [3060] AlphaX Audit final.pdf — no match: Scope is defined as contracts/**/*.sol, but only DEXVault is explicitly named in findings. No specific file paths or contract names listed beyond that.

### Extracted Scope Disposition

Only unambiguous, explicitly eligible project-anchor matches count as coverage. All other address-book references remain visible below.

| Audit | Extracted Reference | Disposition | Candidate(s) | Reason | Counted |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| AlphaX Audit final.pdf | DEXVault | unmatched — not counted | — | mentioned in findings as DEXVault contract | no |
