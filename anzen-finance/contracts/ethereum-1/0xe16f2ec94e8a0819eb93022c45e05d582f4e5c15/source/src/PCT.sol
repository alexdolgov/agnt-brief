/**
 * @title Interest-bearing ERC20-like token for Anzen protocol.
 *
 * This contract is abstract. To make the contract deployable override the
 * `_getTotalPooledSPCT` function. `PCTPool.sol` contract inherits PCT and defines
 * the `_getTotalPooledSPCT` function.
 *
 * PCT balances are dynamic and represent the holder's share in the total amount
 * of SPCT controlled by the protocol. Account shares aren't normalized, so the
 * contract also stores the sum of all shares to calculate each account's token balance
 * which equals to:
 *
 *   shares[account] * _getTotalPooledSPCT() / _getTotalShares()
 *
 * For example, assume that we have:
 *
 *   _getTotalPooledSPCT() -> 10 SPCT
 *   sharesOf(user1) -> 100
 *   sharesOf(user2) -> 400
 *
 * Therefore:
 *
 *   balanceOf(user1) -> 2 tokens which corresponds 2 SPCT
 *   balanceOf(user2) -> 8 tokens which corresponds 8 SPCT
 *
 * Since balances of all token holders change when the amount of total pooled SPCT
 * changes, this token cannot fully implement ERC20 standard: it only emits `Transfer`
 * events upon explicit transfer between holders. In contrast, when total amount of
 * pooled SPCT increases, no `Transfer` events are generated: doing so would require
 * emitting an event for each token holder and thus running an unbounded loop.
 *
 * The token inherits from `Pausable` and uses `whenNotStopped` modifier for methods
 * which change `shares` or `allowances`. This is useful for emergency scenarios,
 * e.g. a protocol bug, where one might want to freeze all token transfers and
 * approvals until the emergency is resolved.
