*******************************************************************************/

// Note that the following tokens are unsupported by the Vault. This list is not meant to be exhaustive, but covers
// many common types of tokens that will not work with the Vault architecture. (See https://github.com/d-xo/weird-erc20
// for examples of token features that are problematic for many protocols.)
//
// * Rebasing tokens (e.g., aDAI). The Vault keeps track of token balances in its internal accounting; any token whose
//   balance changes asynchronously (i.e., outside a swap or liquidity operation), would get out-of-sync with this
//   internal accounting. This category would also include "airdrop" tokens, whose balances can change unexpectedly.
//
// * Double entrypoint (e.g., old Synthetix tokens, now fixed). These could likewise bypass internal accounting by
//   registering the token under one address, then accessing it through another. This is especially troublesome
//   in v3, with the introduction of ERC4626 buffers.
//
// * Fee on transfer (e.g., PAXG). The Vault issues credits and debits according to given and calculated token amounts,
//   and settlement assumes that the send/receive transfer functions transfer exactly the given number of tokens.
//   If this is not the case, transactions will not settle. Unlike with the other types, which are fundamentally
//   incompatible, it would be possible to design a Router to handle this - but we didn't try it. In any case, it's
//   not supported in the current Routers.
//
// * Tokens with more than 18 decimals (e.g., YAM-V2). The Vault handles token scaling: i.e., handling I/O for
//   amounts in native token decimals, but doing calculations with full 18-decimal precision. This requires reading
//   and storing the decimals for each token. Since virtually all tokens are 18 or fewer decimals, and we have limited
//   storage space, 18 was a reasonable maximum. Unlike the other types, this is enforceable by the Vault. Attempting
//   to register such tokens will revert with `InvalidTokenDecimals`. Of course, we must also be able to read the token
//   decimals, so the Vault only supports tokens that implement `IERC20Metadata.decimals`, and return a value less than
//   or equal to 18.
//
//  * Token decimals are checked and stored only once, on registration. Valid tokens store their decimals as immutable
//    variables or constants. Malicious tokens that don't respect this basic property would not work anywhere in DeFi.
//
// These types of tokens are supported but discouraged, as they don't tend to play well with AMMs generally.
//
// * Very low-decimal tokens (e.g., GUSD). The Vault has been extensively tested with 6-decimal tokens (e.g., USDC),
//   but going much below that may lead to unanticipated effects due to precision loss, especially with smaller trade
//   values.
//
// * Revert on zero value approval/transfer. The Vault has been tested against these, but peripheral contracts, such
//   as hooks, might not have been designed with this in mind.
//
// * Other types from "weird-erc20," such as upgradeable, pausable, or tokens with blocklists. We have seen cases
//   where a token upgrade fails, "bricking" the token - and many operations on pools containing that token. Any
//   sort of "permissioned" token that can make transfers fail can cause operations on pools containing them to
//   revert. Even Recovery Mode cannot help then, as it does a proportional withdrawal of all tokens. If one of
//   them is bricked, the whole operation will revert. Since v3 does not have "internal balances" like v2, there
//   is no recourse.
//
//   Of course, many tokens in common use have some of these "features" (especially centralized stable coins), so
//   we have to support them anyway. Working with common centralized tokens is a risk common to all of DeFi.

/**
 * @notice Token types supported by the Vault.

 *
 * STANDARD tokens (e.g., BAL, WETH) have no rate provider.

 * because the underlying stETH token is rebasing, and such tokens are unsupported by the Vault. They may also be
 * tokens like sEUR, which track an underlying asset, but are not yield-bearing. Finally, this encompasses
 * yield-bearing ERC4626 tokens, which can be used to facilitate swaps without requiring wrapping or unwrapping
 * in most cases. The `paysYieldFees` flag can be used to indicate whether a token is yield-bearing (e.g., waDAI),
 * not yield-bearing (e.g., sEUR), or yield-bearing but exempt from fees (e.g., in certain nested pools, where

/**
 * @dev Interface of the ERC20 Permit extension allowing approvals to be made via signatures, as defined in
 * https://eips.ethereum.org/EIPS/eip-2612[EIP-2612].
 *
 * Adds the {permit} method, which can be used to change an account's ERC20 allowance (see {IERC20-allowance}) by
 * presenting a message signed by the account. By not relying on {IERC20-approve}, the token holder account doesn't
 * need to send a transaction, and thus is not required to hold Ether at all.
 *
 * ==== Security Considerations
 *
 * There are two important considerations concerning the use of `permit`. The first is that a valid permit signature
 * expresses an allowance, and it should not be assumed to convey additional meaning. In particular, it should not be
 * considered as an intention to spend the allowance in any specific way. The second is that because permits have
 * built-in replay protection and can be submitted by anyone, they can be frontrun. A protocol that uses permits should
 * take this into consideration and allow a `permit` call to fail. Combining these two aspects, a pattern that may be
 * generally recommended is:
 *
 * ```solidity
 * function doThingWithPermit(..., uint256 value, uint256 deadline, uint8 v, bytes32 r, bytes32 s) public {
 *     try token.permit(msg.sender, address(this), value, deadline, v, r, s) {} catch {}
 *     doThing(..., value);
 * }
 *
 * function doThing(..., uint256 value) public {
 *     token.safeTransferFrom(msg.sender, address(this), value);
 *     ...
 * }
 * ```
 *
 * Observe that: 1) `msg.sender` is used as the owner, leaving no ambiguity as to the signer intent, and 2) the use of
 * `try/catch` allows the permit to fail and makes the code tolerant to frontrunning. (See also
 * {SafeERC20-safeTransferFrom}).
 *
 * Additionally, note that smart contract wallets (such as Argent or Safe) are not able to produce permit signatures, so
 * contracts should have entry points that don't rely on permit.
 */

/**
 * @notice Helper contract to manage protocol and creator fees outside the Vault.
 * @dev This contract stores global default protocol swap and yield fees, and also tracks the values of those fees
 * for each pool (the `PoolFeeConfig` described below). Protocol fees can always be overwritten by governance, but
 * pool creator fees are controlled by the registered poolCreator (see `PoolRoleAccounts`).
 *
 * The Vault stores a single aggregate percentage for swap and yield fees; only this `ProtocolFeeController` knows
 * the component fee percentages, and how to compute the aggregate from the components. This is done for performance
 * reasons, to minimize gas on the critical path, as this way the Vault simply applies a single "cut", and stores the
 * fee amounts separately from the pool balances.
 *
 * The pool creator fees are "net" protocol fees, meaning the protocol fee is taken first, and the pool creator fee
 * percentage is applied to the remainder. Essentially, the protocol is paid first, then the remainder is divided
 * between the pool creator and the LPs.
 *
 * There is a permissionless function (`collectAggregateFees`) that transfers these tokens from the Vault to this
 * contract, and distributes them between the protocol and pool creator, after which they can be withdrawn at any
 * time by governance and the pool creator, respectively.
 *
 * Protocol fees can be zero in some cases (e.g., the token is registered as exempt), and pool creator fees are zero
 * if there is no creator role address defined. Protocol fees are capped at a maximum percentage (50%); pool creator
 * fees are computed "net" protocol fees, so they can be any value from 0 to 100%. Any combination is possible.
 * A protocol-fee-exempt pool with a 100% pool creator fee would send all fees to the creator. If there is no pool
 * creator, a pool with a 50% protocol fee would divide the fees evenly between the protocol and LPs.
 *
 * This contract is deployed with the Vault, but can be changed by governance.
