## ⚠️ Limited Contract Surface

This brief covers only 2 contract implementation(s). The pipeline may not have discovered all deployed contracts for this project.
Coverage assessment and audit matching are based on this incomplete surface.

## Project Description

Contract surface contains 2 implementation(s). Insufficient contract coverage for automated architecture assessment. Manual review recommended.

## Contract Surface Quality

- Indexed contracts: 2; live-surface contracts included: 2 (2 live, 0 unknown).
- Excluded by liveness: 0 inactive, 0 singleton, 0 uninitialized.
- Deployment units: 0/0 live.
- Detected codebases: none
- Dependencies extracted: 0; unverified dependencies: 0.

## Audit Coverage Summary

- Coverage of deployed-live implementations: 1/1 (100.0%)
- Deployed-live implementations: 2 of 2 unique (rest dead/inactive/uninitialized)
- All verified implementations audited (incl. non-live): 1/2
- Verified + Unaudited implementations: 1
- Verified by bytecode match: 0
- Unverified implementations: 0
- Unique implementations: 2
- Raw deployments: 2
- Audits discovered: 2 (2 direct, 0 inherited from forked code)
- Scoreable audits (matched contracts): 1
- ASD (verified + unaudited TVL): n/a
- Latest audit: 2025-04 (aging)
- Audit staleness (calendar age): 0 fresh, 1 aging, 0 stale, 1 unknown
- Coverage code basis (deployed vs audited code): 0 code-matched, 0 diverged (deployed code modified beyond the audited fork baseline), 1 match-unverified
- Tier 1 coverage: No Tier 1 coverage
