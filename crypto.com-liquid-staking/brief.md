## Project Description

Crypto.com Liquid Staking allows users to stake ETH and receive a liquid staking token representing their staked position, enabling them to earn staking rewards while maintaining liquidity.

### Architecture

The protocol consists of a single product family with one core contract, so there are no cross-family relationships or shared infrastructure.
