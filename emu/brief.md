## ⚠️ Limited Contract Surface

This brief covers only 2 contract implementation(s). The pipeline may not have discovered all deployed contracts for this project.
Coverage assessment and audit matching are based on this incomplete surface.

## Project Description

Contract surface contains 2 implementation(s). Insufficient contract coverage for automated architecture assessment. Manual review recommended.

## Contract Surface Quality

- Indexed contracts: 3; live-surface contracts included: 2 (2 live, 0 unknown).
- Excluded by liveness: 1 inactive, 0 singleton, 0 uninitialized.
- Deployment units: 0/0 live.
- Detected codebases: uniswap-v2
- Unverified dependencies: 2/4.
