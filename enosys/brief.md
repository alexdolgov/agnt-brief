## ⚠️ Limited Contract Surface

This brief covers only 2 contract implementation(s). The pipeline may not have discovered all deployed contracts for this project.
Coverage assessment and audit matching are based on this incomplete surface.

## Project Description

Enosys is a multi-chain DeFi ecosystem primarily centered on Flare and Songbird, with additional activity across other supported chains. Its product surface includes DEX/AMM liquidity, farms and yield products, loans/collateralized debt positions, bridge functionality, NFTs, governance/APYCloud, and supporting infrastructure. The currently listed Ethereum contracts represent only a small, incomplete subset of the project surface and should not be treated as project-wide Enosys coverage without mapping the non-Ethereum product contracts.

## Contract Surface Quality

- Indexed contracts: 5; live-surface contracts included: 3 (3 live, 0 unknown).
- Excluded by liveness: 2 inactive, 0 singleton, 0 uninitialized.
- Deployment units: 0/0 live.
- Detected codebases: none
- Dependencies extracted: 1; unverified dependencies: 0.
