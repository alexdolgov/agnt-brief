## Project Description

Flexa is a payments-focused DeFi protocol that enables collateralized stablecoin borrowing and yield-bearing token staking. It provides vaults for depositing collateral to mint synthetic assets and pools for liquidity provision, alongside a governance token (AMP) and staking mechanisms.

### Architecture

The AMP token contract is separate from the Flexa family but likely interacts via governance or staking. Within Flexa, bVaults serve as collateralized debt positions that mint synthetic assets, while the BAC pools provide liquidity for those synthetics; staking contracts like ArcProxy and MasterChef distribute rewards, and the FlexaCollateralManager oversees collateral operations.
