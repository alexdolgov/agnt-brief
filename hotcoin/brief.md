## Project Description

Hotcoin is a centralized exchange (CEX) that provides trading services for digital assets. The on-chain contract likely serves as a wallet or operational address for exchange-related activities on the Scroll network.

### Architecture

Only one contract is identified, serving as the sole on-chain component for the exchange's operations on Scroll.
