## ⚠️ Limited Contract Surface

This brief covers only 1 contract implementation(s). The pipeline may not have discovered all deployed contracts for this project.
Coverage assessment and audit matching are based on this incomplete surface.

## Project Description

Contract surface contains 1 implementation(s). Insufficient contract coverage for automated architecture assessment. Manual review recommended.

## Contract Surface Quality

- Indexed contracts: 6; live-surface contracts included: 1 (1 live, 0 unknown).
- Excluded by liveness: 3 inactive, 2 singleton, 0 uninitialized.
- Deployment units: 0/1 live.
- Detected codebases: none
- Dependencies extracted: 0; unverified dependencies: 0.

## Contract Surface

### ✅ Verified + Audited (0)

- None

### ⚠️ Verified + Unaudited (1)

| Contract Name | Role | Chain | Deployment Unit | Deployments | Audit Status |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| InjectiveToken | token | ethereum | n/a | [`0xe28b3b...ceca30`](./contracts/ethereum-1/0xe28b3b32b6c345a34ff64674606124dd5aceca30/) | ⚠️ Unaudited |

### ✅ Verified by Bytecode + Audited (0)

Source not verified, but runtime bytecode matches a verified implementation (bytecode match).

- None

### ⚠️ Verified by Bytecode + Unaudited (0)

Source not verified, but runtime bytecode matches a verified implementation (bytecode match).

- None

### ❓ Unverified (0)

Source code not publicly verified. These contracts cannot be audited without decompilation or project cooperation.

- None

## Audit Inventory

| Audit | Auditor | Audit Type | Date | Freshness | Inheritance | Scope Format | Matched Contracts | Extraction Confidence |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|

## Coverage Gaps

Verified + unaudited native implementations ranked by TVL:

| Chain | Address | Name | Role | TVL USD | Risk Note |
|---|---|---|---|---:|---|
| ethereum | [`0xe28b3b...ceca30`](./contracts/ethereum-1/0xe28b3b32b6c345a34ff64674606124dd5aceca30/) | InjectiveToken | token | $2,617.33 | Verified native implementation with $2,617.33 on-chain TVL and no extraction_exact/inherited_name_remap audit coverage |

## Origin Classification
