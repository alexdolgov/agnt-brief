## Project Description

KLAYstation is a liquid staking protocol on Klaytn that allows users to stake KLAY tokens and receive a liquid staking derivative in return, enabling them to earn staking rewards while maintaining liquidity.

### Architecture

The protocol consists of a single product family with one core contract that handles all liquid staking functionality, with no additional supporting contracts or shared infrastructure identified.
