## ⚠️ Limited Contract Surface

This brief covers only 3 contract implementation(s). The pipeline may not have discovered all deployed contracts for this project.
Coverage assessment and audit matching are based on this incomplete surface.

## Project Description

Contract surface contains 3 implementation(s). Insufficient contract coverage for automated architecture assessment. Manual review recommended.

## Contract Surface Quality

- Indexed contracts: 9; live-surface contracts included: 3 (1 live, 2 unknown).
- Excluded by liveness: 6 inactive, 0 singleton, 0 uninitialized.
- Deployment units: 0/0 live.
- Detected codebases: none
- Dependencies extracted: 0; unverified dependencies: 0.

## Audit Coverage Summary

- Coverage of deployed-live implementations: 1/1 (100.0%)
- Deployed-live implementations: 1 of 3 unique (rest dead/inactive/uninitialized)
- All verified implementations audited (incl. non-live): 1/1
- Verified + Unaudited implementations: 0
- Verified by bytecode match: 0
- Unverified implementations: 2
- Unique implementations: 3
- Raw deployments: 3
- Audits discovered: 1 (1 direct, 0 inherited from forked code)
- Scoreable audits (matched contracts): 1
- ASD (verified + unaudited TVL): n/a
- Latest audit: 2021-12 (stale)
- Audit staleness (calendar age): 0 fresh, 0 aging, 1 stale, 0 unknown
- Coverage code basis (deployed vs audited code): 0 code-matched, 0 diverged (deployed code modified beyond the audited fork baseline), 1 match-unverified
- Tier 1 coverage: No Tier 1 coverage

## Contract Surface

### ✅ Verified + Audited (1)

| Contract Name | Role | Chain | Deployment Unit | Deployments | Audit Status |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| Manarium | unknown | bsc | n/a | [`0xc80a0a55caf6a7bfb4ee22f9380c4077312c4a35`](./contracts/bsc-56/0xc80a0a55caf6a7bfb4ee22f9380c4077312c4a35/) | ✅ Audited |

### ⚠️ Verified + Unaudited (0)

- None

### ✅ Verified by Bytecode + Audited (0)

Source not verified, but runtime bytecode matches a verified implementation (bytecode match).

- None

### ⚠️ Verified by Bytecode + Unaudited (0)

Source not verified, but runtime bytecode matches a verified implementation (bytecode match).

- None

### ❓ Unverified (2)

Source code not publicly verified. These contracts cannot be audited without decompilation or project cooperation.
