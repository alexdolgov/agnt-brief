# Agentic Audit Brief: Mezo Earn

## Project Overview

- Project: Mezo Earn (`mezo-earn`)
- Website: [https://mezo.org/earn/lock](https://mezo.org/earn/lock)
- Lifecycle: unknown
- Generated: 2026-07-04T14:53:33.063Z
- Pipeline run: v2-pipeline-2026-07-01-3e33f2-16da
- Chains: ethereum
- Contract surface: 3 unique implementations (3 raw deployments)
- DeFi Llama TVL: $57,038,797.19
- On-chain TVL (included contracts): n/a
- TVL by chain: n/a

## Project Description

Governance Incentives. Structurally: 114 project-authored contract(s) across 1 chain(s); 3 ERC20 tokens, 2 ERC721 NFTs; role-gated via AccessControl; upgradeable via ERC1967/UUPS proxies; built on openzeppelin.

### Architecture

The protocol comprises 5 functional families. Its contracts share 26 common project-authored base contract(s) (erc20withpermit, checkpoints, authorizations). Dominant framework: openzeppelin.

## Fork Lineage

This project reuses audited code from **Mellow Protocol** (`mellow-protocol`) in the AssetPool, BeaconBackportRewards, BeaconRewards, BondedECDSAKeep, BondedECDSAKeepFactory, BridgeGovernance, … subsystem.
16 audits inherited from `mellow-protocol`, scoped to that subsystem.

Total inherited audits: 16. Inherited coverage reflects forked/shared code audited by the origin project — it is not a direct audit of this project.

## Contract Surface Quality

- Indexed contracts: 3; live-surface contracts included: 3 (3 live, 0 unknown).
- Excluded by liveness: 0 inactive, 0 singleton, 0 uninitialized.
- Deployment units: 0/0 live.
- Detected codebases: none
- Dependencies extracted: 0; unverified dependencies: 0.

## Audit Coverage Summary

- Coverage of deployed-live implementations: 1/2 (50.0%)
- Deployed-live implementations: 3 of 3 unique (rest dead/inactive/uninitialized)
- All verified implementations audited (incl. non-live): 1/3
- Verified + Unaudited implementations: 2
- Verified by bytecode match: 0
- Unverified implementations: 0
- Unique implementations: 3
- Raw deployments: 3
- Audits discovered: 16 (0 direct, 16 inherited from forked code)
- Scoreable audits (matched contracts): 16
- ASD (verified + unaudited TVL): n/a
- Latest audit: 2026-03 (fresh)
- Audit staleness (calendar age): 8 fresh, 0 aging, 1 stale, 7 unknown
- Coverage code basis (deployed vs audited code): 0 code-matched, 0 diverged (deployed code modified beyond the audited fork baseline), 1 match-unverified
- Tier 1 coverage: 50.0% (ChainSecurity, Sherlock)
