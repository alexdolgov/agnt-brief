## Project Description

Morph Bridge enables cross-chain messaging and asset transfers between Ethereum and the Morph Layer 2 network, using a secure messenger contract to relay messages and facilitate bridging operations.

### Architecture

The single product family relies on a proxy-upgradable L1CrossDomainMessenger contract, which serves as the core bridge component; no additional families or shared infrastructure are present.
