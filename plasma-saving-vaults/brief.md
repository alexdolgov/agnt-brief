- Lifecycle: unknown
- Generated: 2026-07-04T14:53:43.200Z
- Pipeline run: v2-pipeline-2026-07-01-3e33f2-d094
- Chains: plasma
- Contract surface: 3 unique implementations (4 raw deployments)
- DeFi Llama TVL: $33,190,726.81
- On-chain TVL (included contracts): n/a
- TVL by chain: n/a

## Project Description

Onchain Capital Allocator. Structurally: 3 project-authored contract(s) across 1 chain(s); upgradeable via ERC1967/UUPS proxies; built on openzeppelin.

### Architecture

The protocol comprises 3 functional families. Contracts operate as largely independent structural surfaces. Dominant framework: openzeppelin.

## Contract Surface Quality

- Indexed contracts: 4; live-surface contracts included: 4 (3 live, 1 unknown).
- Excluded by liveness: 0 inactive, 0 singleton, 0 uninitialized.
- Deployment units: 0/0 live.
- Detected codebases: none
- Dependencies extracted: 0; unverified dependencies: 0.

## Audit Coverage Summary

- Coverage of deployed-live implementations: 1/1 (100.0%)
- Deployed-live implementations: 2 of 3 unique (rest dead/inactive/uninitialized)
- All verified implementations audited (incl. non-live): 1/2
- Verified + Unaudited implementations: 1
- Verified by bytecode match: 0
- Unverified implementations: 1
- Unique implementations: 3
- Raw deployments: 4
- Audits discovered: 3 (3 direct, 0 inherited from forked code)
- Scoreable audits (matched contracts): 1
- ASD (verified + unaudited TVL): n/a
- Latest audit: 2024-04 (stale)
- Audit staleness (calendar age): 0 fresh, 0 aging, 1 stale, 2 unknown
- Coverage code basis (deployed vs audited code): 1 code-matched, 0 diverged (deployed code modified beyond the audited fork baseline), 0 match-unverified
- Tier 1 coverage: 100.0% (Spearbit)
