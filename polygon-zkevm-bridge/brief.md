## ⚠️ Limited Contract Surface

This brief covers only 1 contract implementation(s). The pipeline may not have discovered all deployed contracts for this project.
Coverage assessment and audit matching are based on this incomplete surface.

## Project Description

Polygon zkEVM Bridge is the canonical bridge for transferring assets between Ethereum and Polygon zkEVM. On Ethereum, the bridge is exposed through a TransparentUpgradeableProxy that delegates to native Polygon/AggLayer bridge implementation logic for custody, deposits, and withdrawals; the logical bridge implementation should not be treated as OpenZeppelin standard-library code.
