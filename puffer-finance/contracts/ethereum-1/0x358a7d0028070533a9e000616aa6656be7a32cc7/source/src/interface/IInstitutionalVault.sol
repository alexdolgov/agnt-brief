     * `totalAssets()` is calculated by summing the following:
     * - WETH held in the vault contract
     * - ETH  held in the vault contract
     * - ETH locked in the Beacon Deposit Contract
     *
     * IMPORTANT:
     * The exchange rate of share token : asset token will not be 100% accurate.
     * Right now, that is not a problem because share token is not transferable.
     * In a future version, where the share token is transferable, we need to make sure that the exchange rate is accurate, by using some kind of Oracle.
     * That oracle will need to report the ETH amount of the validators that are locked in the Beacon Deposit Contract & ETH amount of the validators that are not slashed by the EigenLayer.
     *
     * NOTE on the native ETH deposits:
     * When dealing with NATIVE ETH deposits, we need to deduct callvalue from the balance.
     * The contract calculates the amount of shares(pufETH) to mint based on the total assets.
     * When a user sends ETH, the msg.value is immediately added to address(this).balance.
     * Since `address(this.balance)` is used in calculating `totalAssets()`, we must deduct the `callvalue()` from the balance to prevent the user from minting excess shares.
     * `msg.value` cannot be accessed from a view function, so we use assembly to get the callvalue.
