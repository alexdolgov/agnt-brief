# Agentic Audit Brief: Pulse Rate

## Project Overview

- Project: Pulse Rate (`pulse-rate`)
- Lifecycle: unknown
- Generated: 2026-07-04T14:53:44.236Z
- Pipeline run: v2-pipeline-2026-07-01-3e33f2-17a2
- Chains: ethereum
- Contract surface: 4 unique implementations (4 raw deployments)
- DeFi Llama TVL: $25,091.30
- On-chain TVL (included contracts): n/a
- TVL by chain: n/a

## Project Description

Contract surface contains 0 implementation(s). Insufficient contract coverage for automated architecture assessment. Manual review recommended.

### Architecture

No relationship narrative (skeletal or single-family surface).

## Contract Surface Quality

- Indexed contracts: 4; live-surface contracts included: 4 (0 live, 4 unknown).
- Excluded by liveness: 0 inactive, 0 singleton, 0 uninitialized.
- Deployment units: 0/0 live.
- Detected codebases: none
- Dependencies extracted: 0; unverified dependencies: 0.

## Audit Coverage Summary

- Coverage of deployed-live implementations: 0/0 (0.0%)
- Deployed-live implementations: 0 of 4 unique (rest dead/inactive/uninitialized)
- All verified implementations audited (incl. non-live): 0/0
- Verified + Unaudited implementations: 0
- Verified by bytecode match: 0
- Unverified implementations: 4
- Unique implementations: 4
- Raw deployments: 4
- Audits discovered: 1 (1 direct, 0 inherited from forked code)
- Scoreable audits (matched contracts): 0
- ASD (verified + unaudited TVL): n/a
- Latest audit: 2023-06 (stale)
- Audit staleness (calendar age): 0 fresh, 0 aging, 1 stale, 0 unknown
- Coverage code basis (deployed vs audited code): 0 code-matched, 0 diverged (deployed code modified beyond the audited fork baseline), 0 match-unverified
- Tier 1 coverage: No Tier 1 coverage

### Auditor Coverage

- None

## Contract Surface

### ✅ Verified + Audited (0)

- None

### ⚠️ Verified + Unaudited (0)

- None

### ✅ Verified by Bytecode + Audited (0)

Source not verified, but runtime bytecode matches a verified implementation (bytecode match).

- None

### ⚠️ Verified by Bytecode + Unaudited (0)

Source not verified, but runtime bytecode matches a verified implementation (bytecode match).

- None

### ❓ Unverified (4)

Source code not publicly verified. These contracts cannot be audited without decompilation or project cooperation.
