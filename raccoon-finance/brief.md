## ⚠️ Limited Contract Surface

This brief covers only 1 contract implementation(s). The pipeline may not have discovered all deployed contracts for this project.
Coverage assessment and audit matching are based on this incomplete surface.

## Project Description

Contract surface contains 1 implementation(s). Insufficient contract coverage for automated architecture assessment. Manual review recommended.

## Contract Surface Quality

- Indexed contracts: 31; live-surface contracts included: 1 (1 live, 0 unknown).
- Excluded by liveness: 6 inactive, 24 singleton, 0 uninitialized.
- Deployment units: 0/6 live.
- Detected codebases: none
- Dependencies extracted: 0; unverified dependencies: 0.

## Audit Coverage Summary

- Verified implementations audited: 1/1 (100.0%)
- Verified + Unaudited implementations: 0
- Verified by bytecode match: 0
- Unverified implementations: 0
- Unique implementations: 1
- Raw deployments: 1
- Audits discovered: 1
- Scoreable audits (matched contracts): 1
- ASD (verified + unaudited TVL): n/a
- Latest audit: 2023-08 (stale)
- Staleness: 0 fresh, 0 aging, 1 stale, 0 unknown
- Tier 1 coverage: No Tier 1 coverage
- Note: This protocol is classified as [dead]. ASD of n/a represents exposure in a protocol with dead activity.
