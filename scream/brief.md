## ⚠️ Limited Contract Surface

This brief covers only 1 contract implementation(s). The pipeline may not have discovered all deployed contracts for this project.
Coverage assessment and audit matching are based on this incomplete surface.

## Project Description

Scream is a Fantom-based decentralized lending and borrowing protocol. Its complete contract architecture is not established by the current brief; the listed single contract is insufficient to represent the protocol's lending surface, which likely includes controller, market token, oracle, interest-rate, rewards/distribution, and dripper-related components that must be mapped before coverage can be assessed.

## Contract Surface Quality

- Indexed contracts: 1; live-surface contracts included: 1 (0 live, 1 unknown).
- Excluded by liveness: 0 inactive, 0 singleton, 0 uninitialized.
- Deployment units: 0/0 live.
- Detected codebases: none
- Dependencies extracted: 0; unverified dependencies: 0.

## Audit Coverage Summary

- Verified implementations audited: 0/0 (0.0%)
- Verified + Unaudited implementations: 0
- Verified by bytecode match: 0
- Unverified implementations: 1
- Unique implementations: 1
- Raw deployments: 1
- Audits discovered: 1
- Scoreable audits (matched contracts): 0
- ASD (verified + unaudited TVL): n/a
- Latest audit: n/a (unknown)
- Staleness: 0 fresh, 0 aging, 0 stale, 1 unknown
- Tier 1 coverage: No Tier 1 coverage
- Note: This protocol is classified as [dead]. ASD of n/a represents exposure in a protocol with dead activity.

### Auditor Coverage
