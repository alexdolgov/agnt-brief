## ⚠️ Limited Contract Surface

This brief covers only 1 contract implementation(s). The pipeline may not have discovered all deployed contracts for this project.
Coverage assessment and audit matching are based on this incomplete surface.

## Project Description

Unslashed is a decentralized insurance protocol that allows users to provide underwriting capital and earn premiums by depositing assets into vaults. Unsupported or third-party components such as MasterChef rewards, Uniswap pairs, BAC pools, BlackPoolToken, ArcProxy, and other non-surface tokens or pools should not be described as part of the Unslashed contract surface unless independently verified as Unslashed-owned.

## Contract Surface Quality

- Indexed contracts: 3; live-surface contracts included: 1 (0 live, 1 unknown).
- Excluded by liveness: 0 inactive, 2 singleton, 0 uninitialized.
- Deployment units: 0/2 live.
- Detected codebases: none
- Dependencies extracted: 0; unverified dependencies: 0.

## Audit Coverage Summary

- Verified implementations audited: 0/1 (0.0%)
- Verified + Unaudited implementations: 1
- Verified by bytecode match: 0
- Unverified implementations: 0
- Unique implementations: 1
- Raw deployments: 1
- Audits discovered: 0
- Scoreable audits (matched contracts): 0
- ASD (verified + unaudited TVL): n/a
