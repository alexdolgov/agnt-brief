## ⚠️ Limited Contract Surface

The closed normalized authority records no EVM contract logic or eligible security audit for this project. This is an explicit cohort state, not a skipped export.

## Project Description

No contract logic was present for Arca Labs ArCoin in the closed normalized topography run; this brief does not infer a protocol purpose from missing code.

### Architecture

The activated project remains an explicit cohort member with an empty normalized logic-topography closure.

## Logic Topography

- Exact-run contract rows: 0
- Structural roles: none
- Contract kinds: none
- Detected standards: none
- Frameworks: none
- Upgradeable-pattern rows: 0

## Fork Analysis

0 of 1 contracts are derived from known codebases. 1 contracts have no detected origin.

### Forked Contracts

- None

### Original Contracts (no fork detected - full audit scope)

- UnnamedContract (`0x252739487c1fa66eaeae7ced41d6358ab2a6bca9`, chain 1)

## Contract Surface Quality

- Logic-topography rows: 0; live-surface rows included: 0 (0 live, 0 unknown).
- Excluded by liveness: 0 inactive, 0 uninitialized.
- Deployment units: 1/1 live.
- Detected codebases: none
- Dependencies extracted: 0; unverified dependencies: 0.

## Audit Coverage Summary

- Coverage of address-book-owned deployed-live implementations: not assessable
- Coverage assessment: not_assessable (low confidence) — No confirmed own live-verified denominator is available.
- Address-book implementation classification: 1 own, 0 exact-address-book context/dependencies excluded, 0 exact-address-book entries needing review
- Outside the address book: 42 discovered implementations shown in the inventory but excluded from coverage (0 third-party/infra; 13 standard proxy/library)
- Proxy deployments represented within implementation groups: 23
- Confirmed-live implementations: 1 of 43 unique; 42 retained implementation(s) lack confirmed-live status
- All block-explorer-verified implementations audited (incl. non-live): 0/42
- Verified + Unaudited implementations: 42
- Verified by bytecode match: 0
- Unverified implementations: 1
- Unique implementations: 43
- Raw deployments: 43
- Audits discovered: 0 (0 direct, 0 inherited from forked code)
- Scoreable audits (matched contracts): 0
- ASD (verified + unaudited TVL): n/a
- Latest audit: n/a (unknown)
- Audit staleness (calendar age): 0 fresh, 0 aging, 0 stale, 0 unknown
- Coverage code basis (deployed vs audited code): 0 code-matched, 0 diverged (deployed code modified beyond the audited fork baseline), 0 match-unverified
- Tier 1 coverage: No Tier 1 coverage
