## ⚠️ Limited Contract Surface

This brief covers only 0 contract implementation(s). The pipeline may not have discovered all deployed contracts for this project.
Coverage assessment and audit matching are based on this incomplete surface.

## Project Description

No contract logic was present for Argo Finance in the closed normalized topography run; this brief does not infer a protocol purpose from missing code.

### Architecture

The activated project remains an explicit cohort member with an empty normalized logic-topography closure.

## Logic Topography

- Exact-run contract rows: 0
- Structural roles: none
- Contract kinds: none
- Detected standards: none
- Frameworks: none
- Upgradeable-pattern rows: 0

## Contract Surface Quality

- Operational liveness prerequisite: not_applicable; 0/0 eligible owned address-book contracts resolved from completed operational-liveness snapshots.
- Logic-topography rows: 0; live/inactive and live-deployment-unit totals are withheld until liveness completes.
- Detected codebases: none
- Dependencies extracted: 0; unverified dependencies: 0.

## Audit Coverage Summary

- Coverage of address-book-owned deployed-live implementations: not assessable
- Coverage assessment: not_assessable (low confidence) — No eligible owned address-book contracts are available for an operational-liveness denominator.
- Address-book implementation classification: 0 own, 9 exact-address-book context/dependencies excluded, 0 exact-address-book entries needing review
- Outside the address book: 0 discovered implementations shown in the inventory but excluded from coverage (3 third-party/infra; 0 standard proxy/library)
- Proxy deployments represented within implementation groups: 0
- Operational liveness: not_applicable; 0/0 eligible owned address-book contracts resolved. Deployed-live counts are withheld from coverage.
- All block-explorer-verified implementations audited (incl. non-live): 0/0
- Verified + Unaudited implementations: 0
- Verified by bytecode match: 0
- Unverified implementations: 9
- Unique implementations: 9
- Raw deployments: 9
- Audits discovered: 1 (1 direct, 0 inherited from forked code)
- Scoreable audits (matched contracts): 0
- ASD (verified + unaudited TVL): n/a
- Latest audit: 2022-05 (stale)
- Audit staleness (calendar age): 0 fresh, 0 aging, 1 stale, 0 unknown
- Coverage code basis (deployed vs audited code): 0 code-matched, 0 diverged (deployed code modified beyond the audited fork baseline), 0 match-unverified
- Tier 1 coverage: No Tier 1 coverage

### Auditor Coverage

- None

## Contract Surface

### ✅ Verified + Audited (0)

- None

### ⚠️ Verified + Unaudited (0)

- None

### ✅ Verified by Bytecode + Audited (0)

Source not verified, but runtime bytecode matches a verified implementation (bytecode match).

- None

### ⚠️ Verified by Bytecode + Unaudited (0)

Source not verified, but runtime bytecode matches a verified implementation (bytecode match).

- None

### ❓ Unverified (9)

Source code not publicly verified. These contracts cannot be audited without decompilation or project cooperation.

### Scope Outcome Records

These are completed scope-analysis outcomes, not missing matcher runs. Explicit-zero results retain their unresolved/context references below.

- [19451] DL audit link — no match: Extracted from audited files section: ArgoStaking.sol and Wrapped.sol. Audit date from 'Last Audit was delivered on 5/26/2022'.

### Extracted Scope Disposition

Only unambiguous, explicitly eligible project-anchor matches count as coverage. All other address-book references remain visible below.

|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| DL audit link | ArgoStaking | unmatched — not counted | — | listed in audited files | no |
| DL audit link | Wrapped | unmatched — not counted | — | listed in audited files | no |
