## ⚠️ Limited Contract Surface

This brief covers only 0 contract implementation(s). The pipeline may not have discovered all deployed contracts for this project.
Coverage assessment and audit matching are based on this incomplete surface.

## Project Description

This brief describes the observed EVM deployment and audit surface for CEX.IO. It intentionally limits the description to receipted repository and on-chain evidence instead of inferring a business model.

### Architecture

The pinned logic-topography run contains 2 contract row(s) across bsc, ethereum, polygon. Structural roles: 2 supporting. No upgradeable pattern was identified in these rows.

## Logic Topography

- Exact-run contract rows: 2
- Structural roles: supporting (2)
- Contract kinds: contract (2)
- Detected standards: none
- Frameworks: none
- Upgradeable-pattern rows: 0

## Contract Surface Quality

- Operational liveness prerequisite: not_applicable; 0/0 eligible owned address-book contracts resolved from completed operational-liveness snapshots.
- Logic-topography rows: 2; live/inactive and live-deployment-unit totals are withheld until liveness completes.
- Detected codebases: none
- Dependencies extracted: 0; unverified dependencies: 0.

## Audit Coverage Summary

- Coverage of address-book-owned deployed-live implementations: not assessable
- Coverage assessment: not_assessable (low confidence) — No eligible owned address-book contracts are available for an operational-liveness denominator.
- Address-book implementation classification: 0 own, 2 exact-address-book context/dependencies excluded, 0 exact-address-book entries needing review
- Outside the address book: 2 discovered implementations shown in the inventory but excluded from coverage (0 third-party/infra; 1 standard proxy/library)
- Proxy deployments represented within implementation groups: 3
- Operational liveness: not_applicable; 0/0 eligible owned address-book contracts resolved. Deployed-live counts are withheld from coverage.
- All block-explorer-verified implementations audited (incl. non-live): 0/4
- Verified + Unaudited implementations: 4
- Verified by bytecode match: 0
- Unverified implementations: 0
- Unique implementations: 4
- Raw deployments: 6
- Audits discovered: 1 (1 direct, 0 inherited from forked code)
- Scoreable audits (matched contracts): 0
- ASD (verified + unaudited TVL): n/a
- Latest audit: 2026-03 (fresh)
- Audit staleness (calendar age): 1 fresh, 0 aging, 0 stale, 0 unknown
- Coverage code basis (deployed vs audited code): 0 code-matched, 0 diverged (deployed code modified beyond the audited fork baseline), 0 match-unverified
- Tier 1 coverage: No Tier 1 coverage

## Audit Inventory

| Audit | Auditor | Audit Type | Date | Freshness | Inheritance | Scope Format | Scope Result | Own Matches | Proxy Refs | Excluded/Context | Unresolved | Extraction Confidence |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---:|---:|---:|---:|---|
| [pci.pdf](https://static.cex.io/img/legal/pci.pdf) | PCI DSS | Audit | 2026-03 | fresh | Direct | n/a | no match | 0 | 0 | 0 | 0 | low |

### Scope Outcome Records

These are completed scope-analysis outcomes, not missing matcher runs. Explicit-zero results retain their unresolved/context references below.

- [11551] pci.pdf — no match: The document is a PCI DSS compliance certificate, not a smart contract audit report. No smart contracts or audit scope are mentioned.

### Extracted Scope Disposition

Only unambiguous, explicitly eligible project-anchor matches count as coverage. All other address-book references remain visible below.

- No persisted address-book scope analysis is available.
