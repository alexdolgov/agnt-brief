/// @title ChainedERC4626Oracle
/// @author Storm Labs (https://storm-labs.xyz/)
/// @notice A price oracle adapter for chained ERC4626 vault tokens
/// @dev Handles price conversions between ERC4626 vault shares through multiple levels until reaching
/// the target underlying asset. The oracle automatically converts between share and asset prices
/// through the entire chain using each vault's convertToAssets/convertToShares functions.
///
/// This oracle relies on the convertToAssets/convertToShares functions of the underlying ERC4626 vaults.
/// If the dependent ERC4626 contracts do not implement sufficient protection against donation attacks,
/// sudden price jumps may occur when large amounts of assets are donated to the vaults without a proportional
/// increase in shares. Users should verify the security measures implemented by the underlying vaults.
/// Due to this risk, this oracle should only be used when there is no direct price feed available for the vault tokens.
