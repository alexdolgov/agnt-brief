## ⚠️ Limited Contract Surface

The closed normalized authority records no EVM contract logic or eligible security audit for this project. This is an explicit cohort state, not a skipped export.

## Project Description

No contract logic was present for DefiBox in the closed normalized topography run; this brief does not infer a protocol purpose from missing code.

### Architecture

The activated project remains an explicit cohort member with an empty normalized logic-topography closure.

## Logic Topography

- Exact-run contract rows: 0
- Structural roles: none
- Contract kinds: none
- Detected standards: none
- Frameworks: none
- Upgradeable-pattern rows: 0

## Fork Analysis

0 of 1 contracts are derived from known codebases. 1 contracts have no detected origin.

### Forked Contracts

- None

### Original Contracts (no fork detected - full audit scope)

- UnnamedContract (`0x708c0e...a322ff`, chain 56)

## Contract Surface Quality

- Indexed contracts: 0; live-surface contracts included: 0 (0 live, 0 unknown).
- Excluded by liveness: 0 inactive, 0 uninitialized.
- Deployment units: 1/1 live.
- Detected codebases: none
- Dependencies extracted: 0; unverified dependencies: 0.
