/// @title IFlapTriggerService
/// @author The Flap Team
/// @notice Interface for a generic trigger service that allows smart contracts to schedule
///         function calls to be executed by a trusted backend at a specified time or immediately.
///
/// @dev  ── OVERVIEW ──────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
///
/// The FlapTriggerService acts as a decentralized scheduler that enables smart
/// contracts to request delayed or immediate function callbacks. This is useful for:
///   • Time-delayed operations (vesting unlocks, periodic distributions, etc.)
///   • Backend-coordinated operations requiring MEV protection
///   • Operations that need external computation before execution
///
///
/// ── WORKFLOW ───────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
///
/// 1. **Requester prepares gas payment**
///    Call `getFee()` to determine the amount of native currency (BNB, ETH, etc.)
///    required to pay for the trigger execution.
///
/// 2. **Requester calls requestTrigger()**
///    The requester contract calls `requestTrigger()` with:
///      - `executeAfter`: Unix timestamp for when to execute (0 for immediate)
///      - `msg.value`: Must equal the required gas fee
///    The service records the request and emits a `FlapTriggerRequested` event.
///
/// 3. **Backend monitors events**
///    The off-chain backend listens for `FlapTriggerRequested` events and indexes all
///    pending trigger requests.
///
/// 4. **Backend executes trigger**
///    When the scheduled time arrives (or immediately for executeAfter=0), the backend:
///      - Constructs a transaction to call `trigger(requestId)`
///      - Sends it via an MEV-protected RPC endpoint (e.g., Flashbots, Eden, BloXroute)
///      - This ensures the trigger execution is protected from frontrunning
///
/// 5. **FlapTriggerService calls back**
///    The `trigger(requestId)` method on FlapTriggerService:
///      - Validates the caller has the TRIGGER_ROLE
///      - Marks the request as executed
///      - Calls `requester.trigger(requestId)` with a bounded gas limit
///      - Emits a `FlapTriggerExecuted` event with the outcome
///
/// 6. **Requester handles callback**
///    The requester's `trigger(requestId)` method is invoked. It should:
///      - Check that `msg.sender == address(FlapTriggerService)`
///      - Use the requestId to look up what action to perform
///      - Execute the intended logic within the gas limit
///
///
/// ── TIMING GUARANTEES ──────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
///
/// ⚠ IMPORTANT: Execution at `executeAfter` is NOT guaranteed. The service only
///   guarantees that execution will happen **after** `executeAfter`. Integrators
///   MUST assume that there can be an unpredictable delay between `executeAfter`
///   and the actual on-chain execution, caused by:
///     • Network congestion
///     • Backend processing latency
///     • Block inclusion delays
///     • MEV protection overhead
///
///   Requester contracts MUST be designed to handle late execution gracefully
///   and MUST NOT rely on execution happening at a precise time.
///
///
/// ── SECURITY CONSIDERATIONS ────────────────────────────────────────────────────
///
/// • **Access Control**: Only addresses with TRIGGER_ROLE can call `trigger()`.
///   This role should only be granted to the trusted backend operator(s).
///
/// • **Reentrancy**: Requester contracts MUST implement reentrancy guards in their
///   `trigger(uint256)` callback if they perform external calls or state changes
///   that could be exploited.
///
/// • **Gas Limit**: The maximum gas that can be forwarded to a requester's callback
///   is returned by `getMaxCallbackGas()`. Requesters must ensure their callback
///   logic fits within this limit.
///
/// • **MEV Protection**: The backend MUST use MEV-protected RPC endpoints when calling
///   `trigger()` to prevent frontrunning attacks.
///
/// • **Payment Validation**: The service MUST validate that `msg.value >= getRequiredGasFee()`
///   when `requestTrigger()` is called. Excess payment is accumulated as protocol fees.
///
///
/// ── REQUESTER IMPLEMENTATION GUIDE ─────────────────────────────────────────────
///
/// To integrate with FlapTriggerService, your contract should:
///
/// 1. Store a reference to the FlapTriggerService address
/// 2. Implement a `trigger(uint256 requestId)` function with access control:
///
///    ```solidity
///    address public immutable triggerService;
///
///    mapping(uint256 => bytes) private triggerData;
///
///    function trigger(uint256 requestId) external {
///        require(msg.sender == triggerService, "Only trigger service");
///
///        // Your logic here - use requestId to determine what to do
///        // NOTE: Always assume execution may happen well after executeAfter.
///        bytes memory data = triggerData[requestId];
///        // ... execute the scheduled operation ...
///
///        delete triggerData[requestId]; // Clean up
///    }
///    ```
///
/// 3. When you need a trigger, prepare the payment and call requestTrigger():
///
///    ```solidity
///    function scheduleOperation(uint256 executeAfter) external {
///        uint256 requestId = IFlapTriggerService(triggerService)
///            .requestTrigger{value: requiredFee}(executeAfter);
///
///        triggerData[requestId] = abi.encode(/* your data */);
///    }
///    ```
