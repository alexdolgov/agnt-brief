## Project Description

This brief describes the observed EVM deployment and audit surface for Flux Finance. It intentionally limits the description to receipted repository and on-chain evidence instead of inferring a business model.

### Architecture

The pinned logic-topography run contains 4 contract row(s) across ethereum. Structural roles: 4 core. No upgradeable pattern was identified in these rows.

## Logic Topography

- Exact-run contract rows: 4
- Structural roles: core (4)
- Contract kinds: contract (4)
- Detected standards: accesscontrol (1), erc165 (1), erc20 (1)
- Frameworks: openzeppelin (3), chainlink (1)
- Upgradeable-pattern rows: 0

## Fork Analysis

0 of 10 contracts are derived from known codebases. 10 contracts have no detected origin.

### Forked Contracts

- None

- Detected codebases: none
- Dependencies extracted: 0; unverified dependencies: 0.

## Audit Coverage Summary

- Outside the address book: 34 discovered implementations excluded (0 third-party/infra; 0 standard proxy/library)
- Proxy deployments represented within implementation groups: 1
- Deployed-live implementations: 10 of 44 unique (rest dead/inactive/uninitialized)
- All verified address-book-owned implementations audited (incl. non-live): 0/4
- Verified + Unaudited implementations: 4
- Verified by bytecode match: 0
- Unverified implementations: 6
- Unique implementations: 44
- Raw deployments: 44
- Audits discovered: 1 (1 direct, 0 inherited from forked code)
- Scoreable audits (matched contracts): 0
- Active bug bounty: Immunefi ([program](https://immunefi.com/bug-bounty/fluxfinance/information))
- ASD (verified + unaudited TVL): n/a
- Latest audit: n/a (unknown)
- Audit staleness (calendar age): 0 fresh, 0 aging, 0 stale, 0 unknown
- Coverage code basis (deployed vs audited code): 0 code-matched, 0 diverged (deployed code modified beyond the audited fork baseline), 0 match-unverified
- Tier 1 coverage: No Tier 1 coverage

### Scope Outcome Records

These are completed scope-analysis outcomes, not missing matcher runs. Explicit-zero results retain their unresolved/context references below.

- [20331] Active Bug Bounty Program — no match: The document is a bug bounty program description, not an audit report. No specific contracts are listed in scope; only general references to forked CompoundV2 contracts.

### Extracted Scope Disposition

Only unambiguous, explicitly eligible project-anchor matches count as coverage. All other address-book references remain visible below.

- No persisted address-book scope analysis is available.
