## ⚠️ Limited Contract Surface

This brief covers only 0 contract implementation(s). The pipeline may not have discovered all deployed contracts for this project.
Coverage assessment and audit matching are based on this incomplete surface.

## Project Description

No contract logic was present for Gate in the closed normalized topography run; this brief does not infer a protocol purpose from missing code.

### Architecture

The activated project remains an explicit cohort member with an empty normalized logic-topography closure.

## Logic Topography

- Exact-run contract rows: 0
- Structural roles: none
- Contract kinds: none
- Detected standards: none
- Frameworks: none
- Upgradeable-pattern rows: 0

## Contract Surface Quality

- Operational liveness prerequisite: not_applicable; 0/0 eligible owned address-book contracts resolved from completed operational-liveness snapshots.
- Indexed contracts: 0; live/inactive and live-deployment-unit totals are withheld until liveness completes.
- Detected codebases: none
- Dependencies extracted: 0; unverified dependencies: 0.

## Audit Coverage Summary

- Coverage of address-book-owned deployed-live implementations: not assessable
- Coverage assessment: not_assessable (low confidence) — No eligible owned address-book contracts are available for an operational-liveness denominator.
- Address-book implementation classification: 0 own, 0 exact-address-book context/dependencies excluded, 0 exact-address-book entries needing review
- Outside the address book: 1 discovered implementations excluded (0 third-party/infra; 0 standard proxy/library)
- Proxy deployments represented within implementation groups: 0
- Operational liveness: not_applicable; 0/0 eligible owned address-book contracts resolved. Deployed-live counts are withheld from coverage.
- All verified address-book-owned implementations audited (incl. non-live): 0/0
- Verified + Unaudited implementations: 0
- Verified by bytecode match: 0
- Unverified implementations: 0
- Unique implementations: 1
- Raw deployments: 1
- Audits discovered: 1 (1 direct, 0 inherited from forked code)
- Scoreable audits (matched contracts): 0
- ASD (verified + unaudited TVL): n/a
- Latest audit: 2024-01 (stale)
- Audit staleness (calendar age): 0 fresh, 0 aging, 1 stale, 0 unknown
- Coverage code basis (deployed vs audited code): 0 code-matched, 0 diverged (deployed code modified beyond the audited fork baseline), 0 match-unverified
- Tier 1 coverage: No Tier 1 coverage

### Auditor Coverage

- None

## Contract Surface

### ✅ Verified + Audited (0)

- None

### ⚠️ Verified + Unaudited (1)

| Contract Name | Role | Address-Book Class | Surface | Proxy Deployments | Chain | Deployment Unit | Deployments | Audit Status |
|---|---|---|---|---:|---|---|---|---|
| GateChainToken | unknown | non_address_book | non_address_book_inventory (excluded) | 0 | ethereum | n/a | `0xe66747...454759` | ⚠️ Unaudited |

### ✅ Verified by Bytecode + Audited (0)

Source not verified, but runtime bytecode matches a verified implementation (bytecode match).

- None

### ⚠️ Verified by Bytecode + Unaudited (0)

Source not verified, but runtime bytecode matches a verified implementation (bytecode match).

- None

### ❓ Unverified (0)

Source code not publicly verified. These contracts cannot be audited without decompilation or project cooperation.

- None

## Audit Inventory

| Audit | Auditor | Audit Type | Date | Freshness | Inheritance | Scope Format | Scope Result | Own Matches | Proxy Refs | Excluded/Context | Unresolved | Extraction Confidence |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---:|---:|---:|---:|---|
| [Gate PoR Implementation](https://gimg.staticimgs.com/PoR/Gate.io%20PoR%20Implementation%205.01.2023.pdf) | unknown | Audit | 2024-01 | stale | Direct | n/a | no match | 0 | 0 | 0 | 0 | low |

### Scope Outcome Records

These are completed scope-analysis outcomes, not missing matcher runs. Explicit-zero results retain their unresolved/context references below.

- [20439] Gate PoR Implementation — no match: The report is a security assessment of a proof-of-reserves implementation (Go code, not smart contracts). No Solidity contracts or smart contract files are mentioned in scope.

### Extracted Scope Disposition

Only unambiguous, explicitly eligible project-anchor matches count as coverage. All other address-book references remain visible below.

- No persisted address-book scope analysis is available.

## Coverage Gaps

Verified + unaudited native implementations ranked by TVL:

- None

## Origin Classification

| Origin Kind | Contracts |
|---|---:|
| native | 1 |
| upstream | 0 |
| standard_library | 0 |
| needs_review | 0 |
