## ⚠️ Limited Contract Surface

This brief covers only 3 contract implementation(s). The pipeline may not have discovered all deployed contracts for this project.
Coverage assessment and audit matching are based on this incomplete surface.

## Project Description

No contract logic was present for ImmutableX in the closed normalized topography run; this brief does not infer a protocol purpose from missing code.

### Architecture

The activated project remains an explicit cohort member with an empty normalized logic-topography closure.

## Logic Topography

- Exact-run contract rows: 0
- Structural roles: none
- Contract kinds: none
- Detected standards: none
- Frameworks: none
- Upgradeable-pattern rows: 0

## Fork Analysis

0 of 3 contracts are derived from known codebases. 3 contracts have no detected origin.

### Forked Contracts

- None

### Original Contracts (no fork detected - full audit scope)

- UnnamedContract (`0x58b5484f489f7858dc83a5a677338074b57de806`, chain 1)
- UnnamedContract (`0x5fdcca53617f4d2b9134b29090c87d01058e27e9`, chain 1)
- UnnamedContract (`0x9fabd9cc71f15b9cfd717e117fbb9cfd9fc7cd32`, chain 1)

## Contract Surface Quality

- Logic-topography rows: 0; live-surface rows included: 0 (0 live, 0 unknown).
- Excluded by liveness: 0 inactive, 0 uninitialized.
- Deployment units: 3/6 live.
- Detected codebases: none
- Dependencies extracted: 0; unverified dependencies: 0.

### ✅ Verified by Bytecode + Audited (0)

Source not verified, but runtime bytecode matches a verified implementation (bytecode match).

- None

### ⚠️ Verified by Bytecode + Unaudited (0)

Source not verified, but runtime bytecode matches a verified implementation (bytecode match).

- None

### ❓ Unverified (3)

Source code not publicly verified. These contracts cannot be audited without decompilation or project cooperation.

## Audit Inventory

| Audit | Auditor | Audit Type | Date | Freshness | Inheritance | Scope Format | Scope Result | Own Matches | Proxy Refs | Excluded/Context | Unresolved | Extraction Confidence |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---:|---:|---:|---:|---|
| [DL audit link](https://skynet.certik.com/projects/immutable-x) | CertiK | Audit | 2022-01 | stale | Direct | contract_name | no match | 0 | 0 | 0 | 1 | high |

### Scope Outcome Records

These are completed scope-analysis outcomes, not missing matcher runs. Explicit-zero results retain their unresolved/context references below.

- [20583] DL audit link — no match: Only one contract file (IMXToken.sol) is listed in the audited files section. The audit timeline shows revised date 1/6/2022.

### Extracted Scope Disposition

Only unambiguous, explicitly eligible project-anchor matches count as coverage. All other address-book references remain visible below.

| Audit | Extracted Reference | Disposition | Candidate(s) | Reason | Counted |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| DL audit link | IMXToken | unmatched — not counted | — | Audited Files/SHA256 section lists IMXToken.sol | no |
