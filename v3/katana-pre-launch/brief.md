## Project Description

No contract logic was present for Katana Pre-Launch in the closed normalized topography run; this brief does not infer a protocol purpose from missing code.

### Architecture

The activated project remains an explicit cohort member with an empty normalized logic-topography closure.

## Logic Topography

- Exact-run contract rows: 0
- Structural roles: none
- Contract kinds: none
- Detected standards: none
- Frameworks: none
- Upgradeable-pattern rows: 0

## Fork Analysis

0 of 7 contracts are derived from known codebases. 7 contracts have no detected origin.

### Forked Contracts

- None

### Scope Outcome Records

These are completed scope-analysis outcomes, not missing matcher runs. Explicit-zero results retain their unresolved/context references below.

- [1946] Polygon-Certora (Kat Token) Final report.pdf — no match: Scope section explicitly lists three contracts: KatToken.sol, MerkleMinter.sol, Powutil.sol. Audit date inferred from work period '11.3.2025 to 18.3.2025' as end date.

### Extracted Scope Disposition

Only unambiguous, explicitly eligible project-anchor matches count as coverage. All other address-book references remain visible below.

| Audit | Extracted Reference | Disposition | Candidate(s) | Reason | Counted |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| Polygon-Certora (Kat Token) Final report.pdf | KatToken | unmatched — not counted | — | listed in scope | no |
| Polygon-Certora (Kat Token) Final report.pdf | MerkleMinter | unmatched — not counted | — | listed in scope | no |
| Polygon-Certora (Kat Token) Final report.pdf | Powutil | unmatched — not counted | — | listed in scope | no |
