## Project Description

Lending. Structurally: 25 project-authored contract(s) across 1 chain(s); 7 ERC20 tokens; built on openzeppelin.

### Architecture

The protocol comprises 3 functional families. Its contracts share 12 common project-authored base contract(s) (dsmath, dsauth, dsauthevents). Dominant framework: openzeppelin.

## Contract Surface Quality

- Indexed contracts: 87; live-surface contracts included: 59 (2 live, 57 unknown).
- Excluded by liveness: 28 inactive, 0 singleton, 0 uninitialized.
- Deployment units: 0/0 live.
- Detected codebases: none
- Dependencies extracted: 0; unverified dependencies: 0.

## Audit Coverage Summary

- Coverage of deployed-live implementations: 0/2 (0.0%)
- Deployed-live implementations: 2 of 59 unique (rest dead/inactive/uninitialized)
- All verified implementations audited (incl. non-live): 0/2
- Verified + Unaudited implementations: 2
- Verified by bytecode match: 0
- Unverified implementations: 57
- Unique implementations: 59
- Raw deployments: 59
- Audits discovered: 3 (3 direct, 0 inherited from forked code)
- Scoreable audits (matched contracts): 0
- ASD (verified + unaudited TVL): n/a
- Latest audit: 2024-12 (aging)
- Audit staleness (calendar age): 0 fresh, 1 aging, 2 stale, 0 unknown
- Coverage code basis (deployed vs audited code): 0 code-matched, 0 diverged (deployed code modified beyond the audited fork baseline), 0 match-unverified
- Tier 1 coverage: No Tier 1 coverage
