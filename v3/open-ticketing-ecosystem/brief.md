## Project Description

This brief describes the observed EVM deployment and audit surface for OPEN Ticketing Ecosystem. It intentionally limits the description to receipted repository and on-chain evidence instead of inferring a business model.

### Architecture

The pinned logic-topography run contains 3 contract row(s) across base, ethereum, polygon. Structural roles: 2 core, 1 supporting. 1 row(s) use upgradeable patterns.

## Logic Topography

- Exact-run contract rows: 3
- Structural roles: core (2), supporting (1)
- Contract kinds: contract (3)
- Detected standards: erc20 (2), erc165 (1), erc20permit (1)
- Frameworks: openzeppelin (1), openzeppelin-upgradeable (1), solmate (1)
- Upgradeable-pattern rows: 1

## Fork Analysis

0 of 12 contracts are derived from known codebases. 12 contracts have no detected origin.

### Forked Contracts

- None

## Contract Surface Quality

- Logic-topography rows: 3; live-surface rows included: 3 (3 live, 0 unknown).
- Excluded by liveness: 0 inactive, 0 uninitialized.
- Deployment units: 12/12 live.
- Detected codebases: none
- Dependencies extracted: 0; unverified dependencies: 0.

## Audit Coverage Summary

- Coverage of address-book-owned deployed-live implementations: 0/3 (0.0%)
- Coverage assessment: assessed (high confidence) — Coverage is calculated over confirmed own address-book implementations with no unresolved address-book inventory in the live verified denominator.
- Address-book implementation classification: 12 own, 0 exact-address-book context/dependencies excluded, 0 exact-address-book entries needing review
- Outside the address book: 78 discovered implementations shown in the inventory but excluded from coverage (0 third-party/infra; 0 standard proxy/library)
- Proxy deployments represented within implementation groups: 2
- Confirmed-live implementations: 12 of 90 unique; 78 retained implementation(s) lack confirmed-live status
- All block-explorer-verified implementations audited (incl. non-live): 0/6
- Verified + Unaudited implementations: 6
- Verified by bytecode match: 0
- Unverified implementations: 84
- Unique implementations: 90
- Raw deployments: 93
- Audits discovered: 0 (0 direct, 0 inherited from forked code)
- Scoreable audits (matched contracts): 0
- ASD (verified + unaudited TVL): n/a
- Latest audit: n/a (unknown)
- Audit staleness (calendar age): 0 fresh, 0 aging, 0 stale, 0 unknown
- Coverage code basis (deployed vs audited code): 0 code-matched, 0 diverged (deployed code modified beyond the audited fork baseline), 0 match-unverified
- Tier 1 coverage: No Tier 1 coverage
