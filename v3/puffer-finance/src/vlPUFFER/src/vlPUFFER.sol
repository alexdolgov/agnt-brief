/**
 * @title vlPUFFER
 * @author Puffer Finance
 * @notice vlPUFFER is a lock-based ERC20 token that grants voting power according to lock duration,
 *         compatible with OpenZeppelin ERC20Votes with time-based voting power expiry.
 *
 * This contract allows users to lock PUFFER tokens for a specified duration.
 * In return, they receive vlPUFFER tokens that represent their voting power.
 * The amount of vlPUFFER tokens received is calculated as follows:
 *
 * The multiplier is 30 days. This means if a user locks for 1 year (365 days) they will get x12 multiplier on their PUFFER tokens
 * but the actual unlock time will be slightly lower than 1 year (~360 days).
 *
 * vlPUFFERAmount = pufferAmount * ((unlockTime - block.timestamp) / _LOCK_TIME_MULTIPLIER);
 *
 * vlPUFFER Multiplier examples:
 * 3 months: x3
 * 6 months: x6
 * 9 months: x9
 * 12 months: x12
 * 15 months: x15
 * 18 months: x18
 * 21 months: x21
 * 24 months: x24
 *
 * Because of the rounding, if a user wants to achieve x3 multiplier, they should do a transaction where unlockTime is 3 months + 1 day.
 * In the smart contract, we will round down the unlockTime to the nearest 30 day multiplier, so the user will get x3 multiplier.
 *
 * The user has a grace period to withdraw their tokens after the lock expires, if they don't, they are kicked, and 1% of the PUFFER tokens are sent as a reward to the kicker
