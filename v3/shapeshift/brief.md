- TVL by chain: n/a

## ⚠️ Limited Contract Surface

This brief covers only 0 contract implementation(s). The pipeline may not have discovered all deployed contracts for this project.
Coverage assessment and audit matching are based on this incomplete surface.

## Project Description

This brief describes the observed EVM deployment and audit surface for ShapeShift. It intentionally limits the description to receipted repository and on-chain evidence instead of inferring a business model.

### Architecture

The pinned logic-topography run contains 12 contract row(s) across arbitrum, ethereum, gnosis, polygon. Structural roles: 12 core. No upgradeable pattern was identified in these rows.

## Logic Topography

- Exact-run contract rows: 12
- Structural roles: core (12)
- Contract kinds: contract (12)
- Detected standards: erc20 (2), erc20permit (1)
- Frameworks: openzeppelin (12)
- Upgradeable-pattern rows: 0

## Contract Surface Quality

- Operational liveness prerequisite: not_applicable; 0/0 eligible owned address-book contracts resolved from completed operational-liveness snapshots.
- Logic-topography rows: 12; live/inactive and live-deployment-unit totals are withheld until liveness completes.
- Detected codebases: none
- Dependencies extracted: 0; unverified dependencies: 0.

## Audit Coverage Summary

- Coverage of address-book-owned deployed-live implementations: not assessable
- Coverage assessment: not_assessable (low confidence) — No eligible owned address-book contracts are available for an operational-liveness denominator.
- Address-book implementation classification: 0 own, 12 exact-address-book context/dependencies excluded, 0 exact-address-book entries needing review
- Outside the address book: 114 discovered implementations shown in the inventory but excluded from coverage (0 third-party/infra; 0 standard proxy/library)
- Proxy deployments represented within implementation groups: 6
- Operational liveness: not_applicable; 0/0 eligible owned address-book contracts resolved. Deployed-live counts are withheld from coverage.
- All block-explorer-verified implementations audited (incl. non-live): 0/23
- Verified + Unaudited implementations: 23
- Verified by bytecode match: 0
- Unverified implementations: 103
- Unique implementations: 126
- Raw deployments: 130
- Audits discovered: 3 (3 direct, 0 inherited from forked code)
- Scoreable audits (matched contracts): 0
- ASD (verified + unaudited TVL): n/a
- Latest audit: 2024-06 (stale)
- Audit staleness (calendar age): 0 fresh, 0 aging, 3 stale, 0 unknown
- Coverage code basis (deployed vs audited code): 0 code-matched, 0 diverged (deployed code modified beyond the audited fork baseline), 0 match-unverified
- Tier 1 coverage: No Tier 1 coverage

### Scope Outcome Records

These are completed scope-analysis outcomes, not missing matcher runs. Explicit-zero results retain their unresolved/context references below.

- [9416] rFOX_v02.pdf — no match: Three contracts explicitly listed in scope section.
- [9427] ZokyoAudit.pdf — no match: Only one contract in scope: ShapeShiftDAORouter.sol
- [9429] Zokyo_Security_Audit.pdf — no match: No reason recorded
