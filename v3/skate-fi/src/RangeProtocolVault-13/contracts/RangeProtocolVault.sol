/**
 * @dev Mars@RangeProtocol
 * @notice RangeProtocolVault is fungible vault shares contract that accepts pancake pool tokens for liquidity
 * provision to the corresponding pancake v3 pool. This contract is configurable to work with any pancake v3
 * pool and is initialized through RangeProtocolFactory contract's createVault function which determines
 * the pool address based provided tokens addresses and fee tier.
 *
 * The contract allows minting and burning of vault shares where minting involves providing token0 and/or token1
 * for the current set ticks (or based on ratio of token0 and token1 amounts in the vault when vault does not have an
 * active position in the pancake v3 pool) and burning involves removing liquidity from the pancake v3 pool along with
 * the vault's fee.
 *
 * The manager of the contract can remove liquidity from pancake v3 pool and deposit into a newer take range to maximise
 * the profit by keeping liquidity out of the pool under high volatility periods.
 *
 * Part of the fee earned from pancake v3 position is paid to manager as performance fee and fee is charged on the LP's
 * notional amount as managing fee.
