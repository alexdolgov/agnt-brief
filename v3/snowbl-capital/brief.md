## ⚠️ Limited Contract Surface

This brief covers only 3 contract implementation(s). The pipeline may not have discovered all deployed contracts for this project.
Coverage assessment and audit matching are based on this incomplete surface.

## Project Description

This brief describes the observed EVM deployment and audit surface for Snowbl Capital. It intentionally limits the description to receipted repository and on-chain evidence instead of inferring a business model.

### Architecture

The pinned logic-topography run contains 2 contract row(s) across base, ethereum. Structural roles: 2 supporting. No upgradeable pattern was identified in these rows.

## Logic Topography

- Exact-run contract rows: 2
- Structural roles: supporting (2)
- Contract kinds: contract (2)
- Detected standards: none
- Frameworks: none
- Upgradeable-pattern rows: 0

## Fork Analysis

0 of 3 contracts are derived from known codebases. 3 contracts have no detected origin.

### Forked Contracts

- None

### Original Contracts (no fork detected - full audit scope)

- UnnamedContract (`0x140ff23687e81ac1c80d5cdb7cc59370c872885b`, chain 8453)
- UnnamedContract (`0xd61bfc9ca1d0d2b03a3dd74e2ab81df8e5f606e8`, chain 8453)
- SafeProxy (`0xa199f766c46759356588ef91209aff4f8c7852a6`, chain 8453)

## Contract Surface Quality

- Logic-topography rows: 2; live-surface rows included: 2 (1 live, 1 unknown).
- Excluded by liveness: 0 inactive, 0 uninitialized.
- Deployment units: 3/10 live.
- Detected codebases: none
- Dependencies extracted: 0; unverified dependencies: 0.

## Audit Coverage Summary

- Coverage of address-book-owned deployed-live implementations: 0/1 (0.0%)
- Coverage assessment: assessed (high confidence) — Coverage is calculated over confirmed own address-book implementations with no unresolved address-book inventory in the live verified denominator.
- Address-book implementation classification: 3 own, 2 exact-address-book context/dependencies excluded, 0 exact-address-book entries needing review
- Outside the address book: 5 discovered implementations shown in the inventory but excluded from coverage (0 third-party/infra; 0 standard proxy/library)
- Proxy deployments represented within implementation groups: 0
- Confirmed-live implementations: 3 of 10 unique; 7 retained implementation(s) lack confirmed-live status
- All block-explorer-verified implementations audited (incl. non-live): 0/3
- Verified + Unaudited implementations: 3
- Verified by bytecode match: 0
- Unverified implementations: 7
- Unique implementations: 10
- Raw deployments: 10
- Audits discovered: 0 (0 direct, 0 inherited from forked code)
- Scoreable audits (matched contracts): 0
- ASD (verified + unaudited TVL): n/a
- Latest audit: n/a (unknown)
- Audit staleness (calendar age): 0 fresh, 0 aging, 0 stale, 0 unknown
- Coverage code basis (deployed vs audited code): 0 code-matched, 0 diverged (deployed code modified beyond the audited fork baseline), 0 match-unverified
- Tier 1 coverage: No Tier 1 coverage
