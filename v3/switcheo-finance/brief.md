## ⚠️ Limited Contract Surface

This brief covers only 0 contract implementation(s). The pipeline may not have discovered all deployed contracts for this project.
Coverage assessment and audit matching are based on this incomplete surface.

## Project Description

No contract logic was present for Switcheo Finance in the closed normalized topography run; this brief does not infer a protocol purpose from missing code.

### Architecture

The activated project remains an explicit cohort member with an empty normalized logic-topography closure.

## Logic Topography

- Exact-run contract rows: 0
- Structural roles: none
- Contract kinds: none
- Detected standards: none
- Frameworks: none
- Upgradeable-pattern rows: 0

## Contract Surface Quality

- Operational liveness prerequisite: not_applicable; 0/0 eligible owned address-book contracts resolved from completed operational-liveness snapshots.
- Indexed contracts: 0; live/inactive and live-deployment-unit totals are withheld until liveness completes.
- Detected codebases: none
- Dependencies extracted: 0; unverified dependencies: 0.

## Audit Coverage Summary

- Coverage of address-book-owned deployed-live implementations: not assessable
- Coverage assessment: not_assessable (low confidence) — No eligible owned address-book contracts are available for an operational-liveness denominator.
- Address-book implementation classification: 0 own, 0 exact-address-book context/dependencies excluded, 0 exact-address-book entries needing review
- Outside the address book: 0 discovered implementations excluded (0 third-party/infra; 0 standard proxy/library)
- Proxy deployments represented within implementation groups: 0
- Operational liveness: not_applicable; 0/0 eligible owned address-book contracts resolved. Deployed-live counts are withheld from coverage.
- All verified address-book-owned implementations audited (incl. non-live): 0/0
- Verified + Unaudited implementations: 0
- Verified by bytecode match: 0
- Unverified implementations: 0
- Unique implementations: 0
- Raw deployments: 0
- Audits discovered: 3 (3 direct, 0 inherited from forked code)
- Scoreable audits (matched contracts): 0
- ASD (verified + unaudited TVL): n/a
- Latest audit: 2018-11 (stale)
- Audit staleness (calendar age): 0 fresh, 0 aging, 2 stale, 1 unknown
- Coverage code basis (deployed vs audited code): 0 code-matched, 0 diverged (deployed code modified beyond the audited fork baseline), 0 match-unverified
- Tier 1 coverage: No Tier 1 coverage

### Auditor Coverage

### Scope Outcome Records

These are completed scope-analysis outcomes, not missing matcher runs. Explicit-zero results retain their unresolved/context references below.

- [21333] ChainSecurity_Switcheo_SWITCHEOs_Audit.pdf — no match: Only Broker.sol is explicitly listed in the scope section. No other contracts are mentioned as in scope.
- [21334] ChainSecurity_Switcheo.pdf — no match: Only Broker.sol is explicitly listed in the scope section. No other contracts are mentioned as in scope.
- [24515] Manual audit seed — no match: The provided text is a summary/overview of the audit report, not the full report. It does not list specific contract names, file paths, or a scope section. The audit date is also not present.

### Extracted Scope Disposition

Only unambiguous, explicitly eligible project-anchor matches count as coverage. All other address-book references remain visible below.

| Audit | Extracted Reference | Disposition | Candidate(s) | Reason | Counted |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| ChainSecurity_Switcheo_SWITCHEOs_Audit.pdf | Broker | unmatched — not counted | — | listed in scope section | no |
| ChainSecurity_Switcheo.pdf | Broker | unmatched — not counted | — | listed in scope section | no |
