## ⚠️ Limited Contract Surface

This brief covers only 1 contract implementation(s). The pipeline may not have discovered all deployed contracts for this project.
Coverage assessment and audit matching are based on this incomplete surface.

## Project Description

This brief describes the observed EVM deployment and audit surface for Team Finance. It intentionally limits the description to receipted repository and on-chain evidence instead of inferring a business model.

### Architecture

The pinned logic-topography run contains 1 contract row(s) across ethereum. Structural roles: 1 core. 1 row(s) use upgradeable patterns.

## Logic Topography

- Exact-run contract rows: 1
- Structural roles: core (1)
- Contract kinds: contract (1)
- Detected standards: erc1967proxy (1)
- Frameworks: openzeppelin (1)
- Upgradeable-pattern rows: 1

## Fork Analysis

0 of 1 contracts are derived from known codebases. 1 contracts have no detected origin.

### Forked Contracts

- None

### Original Contracts (no fork detected - full audit scope)

- UnnamedContract (`0x80825c...b2c9fe`, chain 1)

## Contract Surface Quality

- Indexed contracts: 1; live-surface contracts included: 1 (1 live, 0 unknown).
- Excluded by liveness: 0 inactive, 0 uninitialized.
- Deployment units: 1/1 live.
- Detected codebases: none
- Dependencies extracted: 0; unverified dependencies: 0.

## Audit Coverage Summary

- Coverage of address-book-owned deployed-live implementations: 0/1 (0.0%)
- Coverage assessment: assessed (high confidence) — Coverage is calculated over confirmed own address-book implementations with no unresolved address-book inventory in the live verified denominator.
- Address-book implementation classification: 1 own, 0 exact-address-book context/dependencies excluded, 0 exact-address-book entries needing review
- Outside the address book: 0 discovered implementations excluded (0 third-party/infra; 0 standard proxy/library)
- Proxy deployments represented within implementation groups: 0
- Deployed-live implementations: 1 of 1 unique (rest dead/inactive/uninitialized)
- All verified address-book-owned implementations audited (incl. non-live): 0/1
- Verified + Unaudited implementations: 1
- Verified by bytecode match: 0
- Unverified implementations: 0
- Unique implementations: 1
- Raw deployments: 1
- Audits discovered: 2 (2 direct, 0 inherited from forked code)
- Scoreable audits (matched contracts): 0
- ASD (verified + unaudited TVL): n/a
- Latest audit: 2024-07 (stale)
- Audit staleness (calendar age): 0 fresh, 0 aging, 2 stale, 0 unknown
- Coverage code basis (deployed vs audited code): 0 code-matched, 0 diverged (deployed code modified beyond the audited fork baseline), 0 match-unverified
- Tier 1 coverage: No Tier 1 coverage
