/// `SwapRouter` holds it as the in-flight active adapter. Output tokens
/// land back in `SwapRouter`, which measures the balance delta to compute
/// the hop's effective output. The function is `payable` so `SwapRouter`
/// can forward native ETH custody alongside the swap when
/// `step.tokenIn == address(0)`. The interface intentionally does not
/// import the concrete `SwapRouter` contract — adapters depend on the
/// shared `SwapTypes` only.
