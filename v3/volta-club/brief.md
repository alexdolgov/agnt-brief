## Project Description

This brief describes the observed EVM deployment and audit surface for Volta Club. It intentionally limits the description to receipted repository and on-chain evidence instead of inferring a business model.

### Architecture

The pinned logic-topography run contains 4 contract row(s) across avalanche, ethereum. Structural roles: 3 core, 1 supporting. No upgradeable pattern was identified in these rows.

## Logic Topography

- Exact-run contract rows: 4
- Structural roles: core (3), supporting (1)
- Contract kinds: contract (4)
- Detected standards: erc20 (4), erc165 (2), ownable (2)
- Frameworks: openzeppelin (4)
- Upgradeable-pattern rows: 0

## Fork Analysis

0 of 6 contracts are derived from known codebases. 6 contracts have no detected origin.

### Forked Contracts

- None

### Original Contracts (no fork detected - full audit scope)

## Contract Surface Quality

- Indexed contracts: 4; live-surface contracts included: 4 (4 live, 0 unknown).
- Excluded by liveness: 0 inactive, 0 uninitialized.
- Deployment units: 6/8 live.
- Detected codebases: none
- Dependencies extracted: 0; unverified dependencies: 0.

## Audit Coverage Summary

- Coverage of address-book-owned deployed-live implementations: 0/4 (0.0%)
- Coverage assessment: assessed (high confidence) — Coverage is calculated over confirmed own address-book implementations with no unresolved address-book inventory in the live verified denominator.
- Address-book implementation classification: 6 own, 0 exact-address-book context/dependencies excluded, 0 exact-address-book entries needing review
- Outside the address book: 0 discovered implementations excluded (0 third-party/infra; 0 standard proxy/library)
- Proxy deployments represented within implementation groups: 0
- Deployed-live implementations: 6 of 6 unique (rest dead/inactive/uninitialized)
- All verified address-book-owned implementations audited (incl. non-live): 0/4
- Verified + Unaudited implementations: 4
- Verified by bytecode match: 0
- Unverified implementations: 2
- Unique implementations: 6
- Raw deployments: 6
- Audits discovered: 0 (0 direct, 0 inherited from forked code)
- Scoreable audits (matched contracts): 0
- ASD (verified + unaudited TVL): n/a
- Latest audit: n/a (unknown)
- Audit staleness (calendar age): 0 fresh, 0 aging, 0 stale, 0 unknown
- Coverage code basis (deployed vs audited code): 0 code-matched, 0 diverged (deployed code modified beyond the audited fork baseline), 0 match-unverified
- Tier 1 coverage: No Tier 1 coverage

### Extracted Scope Disposition

Only unambiguous, explicitly eligible project-anchor matches count as coverage. All other address-book references remain visible below.

- No persisted address-book scope analysis is available.
