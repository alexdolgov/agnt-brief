## ⚠️ Limited Contract Surface

This brief covers only 1 contract implementation(s). The pipeline may not have discovered all deployed contracts for this project.
Coverage assessment and audit matching are based on this incomplete surface.

## Project Description

Contract surface contains 1 implementation(s). Insufficient contract coverage for automated architecture assessment. Manual review recommended.

## Contract Surface Quality

- Indexed contracts: 1; live-surface contracts included: 1 (1 live, 0 unknown).
- Excluded by liveness: 0 inactive, 0 singleton, 0 uninitialized.
- Deployment units: 0/0 live.
- Detected codebases: none
- Dependencies extracted: 0; unverified dependencies: 0.

## Audit Coverage Summary

- Coverage of deployed-live implementations: 1/1 (100.0%)
- Deployed-live implementations: 1 of 1 unique (rest dead/inactive/uninitialized)
- All verified implementations audited (incl. non-live): 1/1
- Verified + Unaudited implementations: 0
- Verified by bytecode match: 0
- Unverified implementations: 0
- Unique implementations: 1
- Raw deployments: 1
- Audits discovered: 2 (2 direct, 0 inherited from forked code)
- Scoreable audits (matched contracts): 1
- ASD (verified + unaudited TVL): n/a
- Latest audit: 2022-04 (stale)
- Audit staleness (calendar age): 0 fresh, 0 aging, 2 stale, 0 unknown
- Coverage code basis (deployed vs audited code): 0 code-matched, 0 diverged (deployed code modified beyond the audited fork baseline), 1 match-unverified
- Tier 1 coverage: No Tier 1 coverage

## Contract Surface

### ✅ Verified + Audited (1)

| Contract Name | Role | Chain | Deployment Unit | Deployments | Audit Status |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| Factory | registry | avalanche | n/a | [`0xda66a7...7688c1`](./contracts/avalanche-43114/0xda66a7584da7210fd26726efb12585734f7688c1/) | ✅ Audited |

### ⚠️ Verified + Unaudited (0)

- None

### ✅ Verified by Bytecode + Audited (0)

Source not verified, but runtime bytecode matches a verified implementation (bytecode match).

- None

### ⚠️ Verified by Bytecode + Unaudited (0)

Source not verified, but runtime bytecode matches a verified implementation (bytecode match).

- None

### ❓ Unverified (0)

Source code not publicly verified. These contracts cannot be audited without decompilation or project cooperation.

- None
