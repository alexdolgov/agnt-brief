## ⚠️ Limited Contract Surface

This brief covers only 1 contract implementation(s). The pipeline may not have discovered all deployed contracts for this project.
Coverage assessment and audit matching are based on this incomplete surface.

## Project Description

Contract surface contains 1 implementation(s). Insufficient contract coverage for automated architecture assessment. Manual review recommended.

## Contract Surface Quality

- Indexed contracts: 1; live-surface contracts included: 1 (1 live, 0 unknown).
- Excluded by liveness: 0 inactive, 0 singleton, 0 uninitialized.
- Deployment units: 0/0 live.
- Detected codebases: none
- Dependencies extracted: 0; unverified dependencies: 0.

## Audit Coverage Summary

- Verified implementations audited: 1/1 (100.0%)
- Verified + Unaudited implementations: 0
- Verified by bytecode match: 0
- Unverified implementations: 0
- Unique implementations: 1
- Raw deployments: 1
- Audits discovered: 1
- Scoreable audits (matched contracts): 1
- ASD (verified + unaudited TVL): n/a
- Latest audit: 2025-07 (fresh)
- Staleness: 1 fresh, 0 aging, 0 stale, 0 unknown
- Tier 1 coverage: No Tier 1 coverage
- Note: This protocol is classified as [unknown]. ASD of n/a represents exposure in a protocol with unknown activity.

## Contract Surface

### ✅ Verified + Audited (1)

| Contract Name | Role | Chain | Deployment Unit | Deployments | Audit Status |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| TokenERC20 | token | bsc | n/a | [`0xe32f9e...448eaf`](./contracts/bsc-56/0xe32f9e8f7f7222fcd83ee0fc68baf12118448eaf/) | ✅ Audited |

### ⚠️ Verified + Unaudited (0)

- None

### ✅ Verified by Bytecode + Audited (0)

Source not verified, but runtime bytecode matches a verified implementation (bytecode match).

- None

### ⚠️ Verified by Bytecode + Unaudited (0)

Source not verified, but runtime bytecode matches a verified implementation (bytecode match).

- None

### ❓ Unverified (0)

Source code not publicly verified. These contracts cannot be audited without decompilation or project cooperation.

- None
