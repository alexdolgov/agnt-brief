@notice These functions can be used to implement a basic access
        control mechanism, where there is an account (an owner)
        that can be granted exclusive access to specific functions.
        By default, the owner account will be the one that deploys
        the contract. This can later be changed with `transfer_ownership`.
        An exemplary integration can be found in the ERC-20 implementation here:

@notice These functions implement the ERC-20
        standard interface:
        - https://eips.ethereum.org/EIPS/eip-20.
        In addition, the following functions have
        been added for convenience:
        - `name` (`external` `view` function),
        - `symbol` (`external` `view` function),
        - `decimals` (`external` `view` function),

        - `_before_token_transfer` (`internal` function),
        - `_after_token_transfer` (`internal` function).
        The `permit` function implements approvals via
        EIP-712 secp256k1 signatures:
        https://eips.ethereum.org/EIPS/eip-2612.
        In addition, this contract also implements the EIP-5267
        function `eip712Domain`:
        https://eips.ethereum.org/EIPS/eip-5267.
        The implementation is inspired by OpenZeppelin's
        implementation here:
        https://github.com/OpenZeppelin/openzeppelin-contracts/blob/master/contracts/token/ERC20/ERC20.sol,
        as well as by ApeAcademy's implementation here:
        https://github.com/ApeAcademy/ERC20/blob/main/%7B%7Bcookiecutter.project_name%7D%7D/contracts/Token.vy.
@custom:security This ERC-20 implementation allows the commonly known
                 address poisoning attack, where `transferFrom` instructions
                 are executed from arbitrary addresses with an `amount` of `0`.
                 However, this poisoning attack is not an on-chain vulnerability.
                 All assets are safe. It is an off-chain log interpretation issue.
                 The main reason why we do not disallow address poisonig is that
                 we do not want to potentially break any DeFi composability.
                 This issue has been extensively discussed here:
                 https://github.com/pcaversaccio/snekmate/issues/51,
                 as well as in the OpenZeppelin repository:
